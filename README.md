## Project Description
In this project, we are going to make an application that needs to support the high demand of a large number of users accessing it simultaneously. This application will be used in The Cloud Bootcamp Conference, which is a conference that will have participants from all over the world. More than 10,000 people are expected to participate, both in-person and online. To achieve this, the architecture was required to scale automatically based on real-time demand, ensuring system availability and responsiveness during traffic spikes. At some point during the event, 10 vouchers will be drawn for 3 Cloud certifications. The audience will register their email to guarantee participation in the raffle.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were to:
1. **Design a Scalable Architecture:** Create an AWS-based architecture capable of handling high traffic loads, particularly during a virtual cloud conference event with over 10,000 simultaneous users. The system should be able to scale dynamically to manage varying traffic levels effectively.
2. **Implement Auto-Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling policies to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on real-time CPU utilization. This ensures that the application can handle peak loads without manual intervention, maintaining performance and availability.
3. **Ensure High Availability and Fault Tolerance:** Utilize Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and CloudFront to distribute traffic and optimize content delivery across multiple regions. This setup should enhance the applicationâ€™s responsiveness and reliability by preventing any single point of failure.
4. **Monitor and Manage Performance:** Use CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of the application. Set up alarms and triggers to respond to metrics such as CPU utilization, ensuring that scaling actions are taken as needed to maintain optimal performance.
5. **Facilitate User Registration:** Leverage DynamoDB to store user registration data efficiently, ensuring that the system can handle a high volume of concurrent user registrations during the event.
6. **Demonstrate Load Handling Capabilities:** Conduct stress tests to validate that the system can handle substantial traffic and simulate real-world conditions, ensuring that the architecture performs as expected under high load scenarios.

## Project Solution

### Part 1: Initial Setup
1. **Create a DynamoDB Table:** Set up a DynamoDB table to store participant email addresses, which will be used to manage user registrations during the event.
2. **Deploy Application with Elastic Beanstalk:** Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the application. Elastic Beanstalk provisions the necessary EC2 instances and sets up an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to manage incoming traffic.

### Part 2: Auto-Scaling Configuration
1. **Configure Auto-Scaling:** Set up auto-scaling rules within Elastic Beanstalk. The rules are configured to add a new EC2 instance when CPU utilization exceeds 50%, ensuring that the system can handle increased load.
2. **Monitor Auto-Scaling:** Use CloudWatch to monitor the performance and health of the EC2 instances. Set up CloudWatch alarms to trigger auto-scaling actions when necessary.

### Part 3: Load Testing
1. **Simulate Load:** Use the stress utility on an EC2 instance to simulate high CPU load. This step tests the auto-scaling functionality by pushing the CPU utilization beyond 50%.
2. **Monitor Scaling Actions:** Observe the auto-scaling process as it triggers the addition of a new EC2 instance in response to high CPU utilization. Verify that the new instance is properly registered with the Elastic Load Balancer and CloudFront.

### Part 4: Verification
1. **Verify Functionality:** Access the application via the CloudFront URL and ensure that new user registrations are successfully processed and stored in DynamoDB.
2. **Stop Load Testing:** Terminate the stress process to observe the system's scaling down behavior. Confirm that the auto-scaling group reduces the number of instances back to the baseline level as traffic normalizes.

## Project Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of AWS Elastic Beanstalk in deploying and managing a scalable architecture for high-traffic cloud events. The system handled simulated load increases efficiently, scaling up when CPU usage exceeded thresholds, and ensuring minimal downtime. By the end of testing, the architecture was able to support significant loads, distributing traffic effectively across multiple EC2 instances via the Elastic Load Balancer.

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Setting Up Auto Scaling Triggers:** Initially, it was challenging to configure the auto-scaling policies to scale at the appropriate thresholds without over-provisioning. Finding the right balance between cost-effectiveness and performance took several iterations.
2. **Load Testing Accuracy:** During the stress test, ensuring the load properly simulated real-world user behavior was another challenge. Fine-tuning the test required adjustments to parameters to achieve realistic results.
3. **Managing Costs:** Managing the cost of running multiple EC2 instances, especially during long tests, became a challenge. AWS billing for resources during peak loads had to be carefully monitored.

---

## Lessons Learned
1. **Effective Scaling is Key to Performance:** The project highlighted the importance of configuring auto-scaling rules effectively. Too aggressive scaling could lead to unnecessary costs, while delayed scaling could cause performance bottlenecks.
2. **Elastic Beanstalk Simplifies Management:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk proved to be a powerful tool for managing infrastructure with minimal hands-on intervention, allowing for smooth scaling and traffic management.
3. **CloudFront Increases Global Responsiveness:** Incorporating CloudFront made a noticeable difference in global access speed, reducing latency for users across different regions.
4. **Monitoring is Essential:** AWS CloudWatch's monitoring and alerting capabilities provided crucial insights into system performance, helping to optimize auto-scaling decisions and maintain high availability.

## Future Improvements
1. **Optimize Cost Efficiency:** Further refinement of auto-scaling policies to reduce costs without sacrificing performance could be explored. This includes using more advanced monitoring tools and scaling based on metrics like memory utilization alongside CPU.
2. **Use of Spot Instances:** For non-critical operations, incorporating spot instances could further reduce costs while maintaining system availability during high demand.
3. **Explore Serverless Architectures:** While EC2 provided reliable computing power, future iterations could explore the use of AWS Lambda to reduce infrastructure overhead and improve scalability.
4. **Automated Testing Framework:** Implementing automated load testing frameworks (e.g., using AWS Load Testing tools) could provide more accurate and repeatable stress testing scenarios, leading to better insights into system performance under load.
